Scenario 1 – KNN (Breast Cancer Prediction)

Dataset (Kaggle – Public)
Breast Cancer Dataset Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset

Using the Breast Cancer Dataset, the model predicts whether a tumor is Benign or Malignant based on features like radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness. After preprocessing, encoding labels, and applying feature scaling, a KNN classifier is trained. Different K values are tested, and performance is evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Visualizations include a Confusion Matrix and Accuracy vs K plot.

Scenario 2 – Decision Tree (Loan Prediction)

Dataset (Public / Standard Dataset)
Loan Prediction Dataset Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication

Using the Loan Prediction Dataset, the model predicts whether a loan should be Approved or Rejected. After handling missing values and encoding categorical features, a Decision Tree classifier is trained. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics, and feature importance along with tree depth analysis is performed to detect overfitting.# 24ADI003_RAMYA-R_24BAD096_EX5
